# Lab 25 - Bouncing Ball

You are going to make a ball travel around the screen and bounce off of any edges it encounters.

## Instructions

1. Choose an image for your ball.  The website [Kenney.nl](https://www.kenney.nl) has lots of assets that are free to use.
2. Setup a Pygame window and a Game Loop.  Make it so the game is quit when the X is clicked.
3. Load your image and start it moving in your window.
4. Set things up so your ball will eventually hit all 4 sides of the window.
5. When your ball hits a side of your window it should bounce off, leaving at the same angle that it approached at.
6. Make your game run at a reasonable FPS.
